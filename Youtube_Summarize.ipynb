        "[03:33.440 --> 03:35.960]  And you get billed by the number of tokens.\n",
        "[03:35.960 --> 03:37.280]  So less tokens, but\n",
        "[03:37.280 --> 03:41.400]  the same sentence is usually cheaper for you as a consumer.\n",
        "[03:41.400 --> 03:44.560]  So we're using TickToken here, which is straight from OpenAI.\n",
        "[03:44.560 --> 03:49.960]  This is the exact library that OpenAI uses to encode their GPT models.\n",

        "[04:14.680 --> 04:18.880]  So I ran this and this is just an example sentence.\n",
        "[04:18.880 --> 04:22.000]  What's the difference between a Beer Nuts and Deer Nuts?\n",
        "[04:22.000 --> 04:26.400]  Beer Nuts are about $5, Deer Nuts are just under a buck.\n",

        "[04:29.720 --> 04:35.520]  So this one cost about 0.000135 if you're using GPT-4-0.\n",
        "[04:35.520 --> 04:39.320]  And the funny thing about OpenAI is that they didn't update TickToken for\n",

        "[04:40.800 --> 04:42.360]  So this is just a guesstimate.\n",

        "[04:46.840 --> 04:49.200]  So pretty table is just library in Python.\n",
        "[04:49.200 --> 04:51.960]  So you can make tables in your terminal.\n",
        "[04:51.960 --> 04:57.240]  I want rows and columns so I can see which one is cost more than which.\n",
        "[04:58.440 --> 05:01.160]  So that's all I'm doing here, very long function.\n",
        "[05:01.160 --> 05:04.920]  All it's doing here is take into account scraped content,\n",

        "[05:13.040 --> 05:18.120]  First we're gonna install a good old friend, BeautifulSoup4.\n",
        "[05:20.360 --> 05:23.920]  This is the most straightforward way to scrape any website.\n",
        "[05:23.920 --> 05:28.400]  And probably the easiest way for them to detect that you're scraping and\n",
        "[05:28.400 --> 05:29.440]  ban you.\n",
        "[05:29.440 --> 05:34.080]  So it's not very sophisticated unless you bundle on a bunch of other tools.\n",
        "[05:34.080 --> 05:38.360]  Okay, so we got a function to scrape the web with BeautifulSoup.\n",
        "[05:38.400 --> 05:39.960]  We're not gonna use that yet.\n",
        "[05:39.960 --> 05:42.520]  What we're gonna do is we're gonna run all of them at the same time.\n",
        "[05:42.520 --> 05:44.360]  So I'm just gonna set up a bunch of stuff here.\n",
        "[05:44.360 --> 05:46.240]  So here's Gina AI.\n",
        "[05:46.240 --> 05:48.760]  This is what I'm talking about when I say this one is dead simple.\n",
        "[05:50.480 --> 05:54.200]  All you gotta do is just add the string before the actual URL that you wanna\n",
        "[05:54.200 --> 05:55.480]  scrape.\n",
        "[05:55.480 --> 05:56.880]  And it's completely free.\n",
        "[05:56.880 --> 05:59.800]  I don't know what the deal is, but use it, it's free.\n",
        "[06:01.080 --> 06:02.120]  No strings attached.\n",
        "[06:02.120 --> 06:05.960]  I mean, maybe they're trying to do some market research or something.\n",
        "[06:05.960 --> 06:06.880]  But yeah, it's great.\n",
        "[06:06.880 --> 06:08.880]  The jobs of VC money they could-\n",
        "[06:08.880 --> 06:09.480]  Yeah.\n",
        "[06:09.480 --> 06:10.000]  They could blow.\n",
        "[06:11.400 --> 06:12.000]  Absolutely.\n",

        "[06:22.560 --> 06:24.240]  So Mendable, like I said recently,\n",
        "[06:24.240 --> 06:27.880]  pivoted from, I guess not fully pivoted from, but\n",
        "[06:27.880 --> 06:30.760]  they were doing documentation chatbots.\n",
        "[06:30.760 --> 06:34.120]  So you go on like Langchain, Lama Index, all these companies.\n",
        "[06:34.120 --> 06:36.520]  You can chat with a little chatbot in the bottom.\n",
        "[06:36.520 --> 06:38.080]  So we're gonna try this one too.\n",
        "[06:39.160 --> 06:40.680]  But this one requires an API key.\n",
        "[06:42.760 --> 06:48.440]  And they gave everybody like, I think, 300 tokens for free.\n",
        "[06:48.440 --> 06:52.240]  I'm not sure how many websites you can scrape with that.\n",
        "[06:53.760 --> 06:55.520]  But-\n",
        "[06:55.520 --> 06:56.560]  So from these other tools,\n",
        "[06:56.560 --> 07:01.040]  the output is all text normalized or is it still pretty wrong?\n",
        "[07:01.040 --> 07:03.120]  It's only in markdown.\n",
        "[07:03.120 --> 07:07.880]  So they're all in markdown for some reason.\n",
        "[07:07.880 --> 07:10.280]  Maybe because of large language models.\n",
        "[07:10.280 --> 07:14.640]  Like they made these tools specifically to output markdown from\n",

        "[07:18.280 --> 07:18.780]  Yeah.\n",
        "[07:21.200 --> 07:22.720]  So it's also like string.\n",
        "[07:22.720 --> 07:24.760]  So there's no like, just pure string.\n",
        "[07:24.760 --> 07:26.040]  You get a string back, like very long.\n",
        "[07:28.440 --> 07:31.160]  Okay, this is the moment that we run everything.\n",
        "[07:33.640 --> 07:34.600]  So I'm just gonna run this.\n",

        "[12:00.840 --> 12:05.880]  Yeah, especially, I think for this one, if you hit an image that has an entire\n",

        "[12:09.880 --> 12:11.520]  This one also get the entire thing.\n",

        "[12:33.160 --> 12:34.720]  Otherwise, you lose a lot of resolution.\n",
        "[12:36.000 --> 12:40.280]  But again, if you want a reasoning task to be done, then you don't need that.\n",

        "[12:43.320 --> 12:48.080]  All right, so it's pretty obvious which one we should be paying for.\n",
        "[12:49.600 --> 12:51.680]  Not knowing anything else about these companies.\n",
        "[12:51.680 --> 12:58.520]  But now we're going to use OpenAI to kind of like try to do some extraction.\n",

        "[13:41.320 --> 13:45.400]  like GPT-4, or chat GPT sounds so flirtatious?\n",
        "[13:45.400 --> 13:53.400]  Yeah, there's so many memes about that on Twitter.\n",
        "[13:53.400 --> 13:58.280]  But okay, so this is just a utility function to then display\n",
        "[13:58.280 --> 14:01.160]  the extracted content on another table.\n",
        "[14:02.520 --> 14:07.240]  Because table and console is what we need to compare these things.\n",
        "[14:08.160 --> 14:13.280]  All right, so what I'm doing here is just run GPT-4.0 through each of\n",
        "[14:13.280 --> 14:16.680]  the inputs that we got before, like the entire input.\n",
        "[14:16.680 --> 14:20.320]  So it could be like 50,000 tokens.\n",
        "[14:20.320 --> 14:23.040]  Like it's not my money, it's Invest Ottawa's money.\n",
        "[14:23.040 --> 14:26.760]  So I'm just running it through GPT-4.0 right now.\n",
        "[14:26.760 --> 14:42.680]  Okay, so very, very simple entity extraction task using GPT-4.0.\n",
        "[14:42.680 --> 14:47.760]  All I did was I put in a kind of like a chain,\n",
        "[14:47.760 --> 14:51.880]  an LLM chain, and just be like, do, do, do, do, do, do.\n",

        "[14:57.160 --> 14:59.120]  So I give one website at a time.\n",
        "[14:59.120 --> 15:01.920]  And then we turn a JSON with three keys.\n",
        "[15:01.920 --> 15:06.400]  Cheapest, which is the cheapest tier, name of it, and then a price.\n",
        "[15:06.400 --> 15:08.440]  And then I just give each one like a type, so\n",

        "[15:11.600 --> 15:14.800]  And then the middle tier is the most expensive one.\n",

        "[15:17.480 --> 15:22.280]  And always, what OpenAI does is it tells you that you should always,\n",
        "[15:22.280 --> 15:25.440]  if you want JSON back, use type JSON object, but\n",
        "[15:25.440 --> 15:27.640]  also say in your prompt that you want JSON back.\n",
        "[15:27.640 --> 15:29.680]  So you always need those two things.\n",
        "[15:30.920 --> 15:35.200]  But it's not really surprising that from BeautifulSuit we get nothing, so\n",
        "[15:35.200 --> 15:37.640]  we can't extract anything here.\n",
        "[15:37.640 --> 15:42.160]  Our JSON is completely zero and empty string,\n",

        "[16:04.240 --> 16:07.960]  This is weird because I gave it a type which was float, and\n",
        "[16:07.960 --> 16:09.640]  it gave me a string here.\n",
        "[16:09.640 --> 16:14.720]  It's still useful, but not technically accurate.\n",
        "[16:16.080 --> 16:20.720]  And it comes out to GNI, price as variable.\n",
        "[16:20.720 --> 16:25.200]  So they're kind of ignoring my instructions a little bit.\n",

        "[16:37.320 --> 16:40.240]  you need to be very specific about your prompt.\n",
        "[16:40.240 --> 16:42.480]  And just take care of most edge cases.\n",
        "[16:43.160 --> 16:50.600]  So again, it seems like most of these tools pass the test.\n",
        "[16:52.600 --> 16:54.720]  It's just a matter of whether or\n",
        "[16:54.720 --> 16:57.760]  not you're gonna burn ten times the amount of money and\n",
        "[16:57.760 --> 17:01.480]  do scraping manually using Beelzebub and your custom tools.\n",
        "[17:01.480 --> 17:05.840]  Or you can kind of use one of these third party tools and just get\n",

        "00:05:36.240 is that simple things should be simple\n",

        "00:05:45.680 right so when you talk about a pipeline\n",

        "00:05:50.720 testing performance monitoring uh uh\n",

        "00:06:04.639 deployment metadata no tracking\n",

        "00:06:09.680 simple\n",
        "00:06:11.520 all i want to do is to develop a model\n",

        "00:07:16.960 go to a notebook you write some code and\n",
        "00:07:20.400 in that code you can basically you know\n",

        "00:13:14.160 right and i've basically gotten this we\n",

        "00:14:15.360 we're talking about right we're\n",
        "00:14:17.279 basically saying we want to develop a\n",
        "00:14:18.959 model but having developed the model\n",
        "00:14:21.360 let's look at this this entire workflow\n",

        "00:14:28.959 how to do that in python so that you can\n",
        "00:14:31.440 automate it really well so this is\n",
        "00:14:33.519 basically the workflow so you've now\n",
        "00:14:36.560 taken the model you've saved it\n",
        "00:14:38.880 now you can basically upload the model\n",
        "00:14:41.920 as a vertex ai model\n",
        "00:14:44.399 and then deploy the model to an endpoint\n",
        "00:14:47.839 in such a way that when a client request\n",
        "00:14:50.639 comes in through json\n",
        "00:14:52.639 this endpoint basically invokes your\n",
        "00:14:55.040 model\n",
        "00:14:56.000 and sends back a json payload and the\n",
        "00:14:58.639 endpoint doesn't contain just one model\n",
        "00:15:01.839 the end point can contain multiple\n",
        "00:15:04.079 models and do a traffic split between\n",
        "00:15:06.720 them\n",
        "00:15:07.600 so that's the basic basic idea so the\n",
        "00:15:10.320 concepts here are you have your model\n",
        "00:15:12.880 just model files you upload them into a\n",
        "00:15:15.440 model object\n",
        "00:15:16.880 you put model objects into endpoints and\n",
        "00:15:20.000 you basically do traffic splits in the\n",
        "00:15:22.639 endpoint between different models so\n",
        "00:15:25.120 let's start with the first thing you\n",
        "00:15:27.199 want to train a model you want to have a\n",
        "00:15:28.959 data set\n",
        "00:15:30.560 so the reason that you want to have a\n",
        "00:15:32.320 data set that is in vertex ai\n",
        "00:15:35.040 we think of four different types of\n",
        "00:15:37.279 objects\n",
        "00:15:38.480 a data set which could be structured or\n",
        "00:15:40.959 unstructured it will have metadata it\n",
        "00:15:43.600 will have versions so that you know\n",
        "00:15:46.079 given a model what version of data was\n",
        "00:15:48.800 used to train that model that's part of\n",
        "00:15:50.560 the metadata of that model\n",
        "00:15:52.880 the next thing that you will often have\n",
        "00:15:54.639 is that you'll have the model itself you\n",
        "00:15:56.399 trained a model now you have model files\n",
        "00:15:58.880 your saved model in tensorflow right you\n",
        "00:16:01.360 have machine learning model artifact so\n",
        "00:16:04.079 those files that's your model object and\n",
        "00:16:07.440 the end point is the thing that gets\n",
        "00:16:09.440 called it contains multiple models and\n",
        "00:16:12.240 you orchestrate all of these things\n",
        "00:16:14.800 using a training job or a pipeline right\n",
        "00:16:17.759 and the pipeline basically is take a\n",
        "00:16:20.320 data set train a model on it deploy to\n",
        "00:16:22.560 the endpoint\n",
        "00:16:24.320 so essentially the way you start is that\n",
        "00:16:27.279 you basically have now in my case a\n",
        "00:16:29.600 train on vertex ai right and i basically\n",

        "00:23:54.640 not going to talk about these two two\n",

        "00:24:19.520 you don't want to create an end point if\n",

        "00:24:44.159 as you go along so that's what i'm doing\n",
        "00:24:46.240 here i'm saying go ahead and get me all\n",
        "00:24:48.960 the end points with a specific display\n",
        "00:24:51.279 name\n",
        "00:24:52.159 and order it by the descending order of\n",

        "00:24:59.760 and that's the end point that i'm going\n",
        "00:25:01.520 to deploy ideally you've only created an\n",
        "00:25:04.080 endpoint once\n",
        "00:25:05.840 and then from then on you're just\n",

        "00:25:09.760 right so create the endpoint with a\n",

        "00:25:27.600 given 100 of the traffic\n",

        "00:25:44.159 and that's pretty much it right\n",

        "00:25:50.159 an endpoint you want to use it\n",
        "00:25:53.120 so the way that you can use it is you\n",

        "00:26:05.840 something and you pass that in\n",
        "00:26:07.840 and\n",
        "00:26:08.720 you basically say endpoints predict and\n",

        "00:26:30.720 use python\n",
        "00:26:32.240 you basically get the end point as\n",
        "00:26:34.240 before\n",
        "00:26:35.360 and then you basically create a no\n",

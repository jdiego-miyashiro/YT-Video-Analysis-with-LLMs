[00:00:00---->00:00:45]:
foreign so this is the first lecture in spectroscopy formally so those of you who've watched the I guess 10 or 15 minute introduction lecture um we know that I'm talking to an empty room so I'm trying to recreate the lecture experience here as much as possible um but I hope you are all enjoying this course from wherever you're viewing it and really in this course I want to um talk about to get something like this here this is a structure um uh we see the Spectrum has lots of

Video Extract : Introduction to Molecular Spectroscopy: Lecture 1 Rotational Spectroscopy
[00:00:45---->00:01:30]:
Peaks on it this particularly this particular Spectrum all the Peaks are regularly spaced uh there's a kind of a shape in the Spectrum you're getting a sense of increase in an increase in transition intensity and decrease again and this course is about when you get a spectrum how do you find out something with a molecule all right so as I mentioned in the sort of 10 minutes preamble um this means we need to know the underlying theory for what I'm interested in or what I want to share with you in this course is how do we find that structural information about the molecule how do we use electrostic experimental so there are lots of textbooks in photography

Video Extract : Introduction to Molecular Spectroscopy: Lecture 1 Rotational Spectroscopy
[00:01:30---->00:02:15]:
um uh Africans is obviously the core quiz cam textbook most of what we talk about will be in the chapters and rotational conversational catastrophe at the moment chapter 12 to 13 which you might have to shift you're looking at the classic introduction and it's I'm only National unit now because it's a very useful textbook for third year um drawing my general notation and so on from from that book that's a standard introduction to collectors across from the textbook um part of petrocity which you'll probably find online is a more advanced text but if you like a big into stock a

[00:02:15---->00:03:00]:
little bit more deeply uh this is this is quite a good book and again Shoppers five to seven relate to the three parts across the way we'll be talking in our course um so obviously uh spectroscopy is an essential tool for chemist you've likely come across it already experimentally and definitely an electric course in first year and it's informed by our understanding of theory okay so what we understand from Theory we can bring to spectroscopy but as I will hopefully say quite a lot it allows us to relate this Theory and observation so we can use the theory to go okay that's what's happening that's why I'm seeing the space in there but that's why that is about intensity and this is what it tells me about the molecule I'm looking

Video Extract : Introduction to Molecular Spectroscopy: Lecture 1 Rotational Spectroscopy
[00:03:00---->00:03:45]:
at so obviously atrocity is a topic depends on who you talk to it doesn't really certainly formal section of chemistry because it covers everything okay there's organic patrons could be inorganic petroscopy physical spectroscopy analytical spectroscopy so obviously it relates for all kinds of chemistry so we can use it for looking at reaction rates solicit interactions photochemical interactions and my own background of the photochemist looking at Interstellar compounds astrochemistry and so on whatever your flavor of chemistry is I'm afraid otroscopy will be there Along by your side so this particular items and outcomes of this course but really I think the the fundamental take-home message is the aim is to give you some sense of how useful

Video Extract : Introduction to Molecular Spectroscopy: Lecture 1 Rotational Spectroscopy
[00:03:45---->00:04:30]:
petroscopy is and how you can use it to really get some in-depth knowledge about molecules okay so it's spectroscopy the key word is transitions so in the Preamble I mentioned that we're able to talk we're able to describe energy levels and energy levels are quantized is the trust would be what we're interested in and the difference between those energy levels what we call a transition so a transition is essentially movement of electrons from one energy level to another and usually this is done by energizing the molecule providing it with energy so that we get absorption or allowing energy to be room to be dissipated from the molecule so that we

Video Extract : Introduction to Molecular Spectroscopy: Lecture 1 Rotational Spectroscopy
[00:04:30---->00:05:15]:
get a mission so the kind of transitions we will come across are well we mentioned that molecules can be described by What's called the potential energy fire in the Preamble lecture so this potential energy Curve will have several electronic levels so for example Mo Theory you know that blacker orbitals will be a series of molecular orbitals of increasing the energy describing a diatomic molecule for example so that could be all of these lines here and um within each of those electronic energy levels there will be lots of vibrational energy levels and within each of those vibrational energy levels there will be

Video Extract : Introduction to Molecular Spectroscopy: Lecture 1 Rotational Spectroscopy
[00:05:15---->00:06:00]:
lots of rotation in the levels and so on down the energy change what this means then is we can we can get three types of transition doesn't this very simple diagram we can get a transition whereby an electron has moved from an occupied orbital so we think of our Mo diagram there may be some electronic level that has electrons in it to an unoccupied orbital so the next one up so we call this a homo hyacy molecular polymer lowest unoccupied molecular orbital transition transition because there's blue line here this long line moving from what we call a ground state in a planet state is essentially what we are studying in UV there's petroscopy we are studying the whole

Video Extract : Introduction to Molecular Spectroscopy: Lecture 1 Rotational Spectroscopy
[00:06:00---->00:06:45]:
shift of electrons from one part of the molecule to to another and as you can see because now the molecule has changed this is a different potential energy curve of a different energy so you do this because to do with City we transitions similarly in infrared spectroscopy we don't see movement of electrons from one part of the molecule to another we don't see these electronic transitions but we do see the molecules vibrating more so that means that the distribution of electrons must be populated across a wider range of vibrational levels so these are called vibrational transitions so we'll see for example the vibrational transition from one damage level some of them I just realized sorry I described these energy levels here's molecular orbital energy

Video Extract : Introduction to Molecular Spectroscopy: Lecture 1 Rotational Spectroscopy
[00:06:45---->00:07:30]:
level but of course this is warming electoral language level you'd have a memory diagram is another one so these lines here obviously vibrational energy levels and everything those vibrational energy levels you have a series of rotation manage level so this is where we can provide the sample for example microwave radiation time to provide with enough energy just to rotate faster and faster and faster so these transitions of Interest are are summarized so for any transition the energy will be the amount of energy that's transpared that's acquired for example to go from one electronic state to another which we described using what

Video Extract : Introduction to Molecular Spectroscopy: Lecture 1 Rotational Spectroscopy
[00:07:30---->00:08:15]:
are called term values you basically mean the amount of energy needed for any transition might involves some electronic transition plus some vibrational transition plus some rotational transition so you see the E for electronic V for vibrational and J is the term we use in rotational potosity so in this course we are going to look at rotation of atrocity vibrational spectroscopy and electronic spectroscopy so that we will be able to describe quantify and utilize all of these different active Energies an important point to notice here is that we can describe energy in joules the SI unit or in wave numbers using cm

Video Extract : Introduction to Molecular Spectroscopy: Lecture 1 Rotational Spectroscopy
[00:08:15---->00:09:00]:
to minus one so here you see a happy energy in joules divided by HC gives me the energy and wave numbers so in this course wherever I use the symbol the Greek letter Epsilon that means the energy I'm described in here some wave numbers I'll be almost always use that for petrostitute forever use the symbol capital E the energy will be in joules all right well you have to use that on certain occasions but normally we use energy or red windows okay so as I mentioned there was a sort of a short pre-lecture uh catching up on all the kind of major points that when you put into this course so if you haven't had a chance I would recommend that you

Video Extract : Introduction to Molecular Spectroscopy: Lecture 1 Rotational Spectroscopy
[00:09:00---->00:09:45]:
go over it off but really in this first lecture what I want to do now is um focus on the first of our three spectross figures which is um macro is spectroscopy or rotational Etc so we mentioned in the pre-lecture that the microwaves are pretty low energy radiation so they fall Beyond infrared to infrared radiation and elect the election and microwaves tend to provide enough energy to rotate molecules and one thing I want to pose here on is how does this actually happen what is happening when life interacts with matter and when life interested matter what we

Video Extract : Introduction to Molecular Spectroscopy: Lecture 1 Rotational Spectroscopy
[00:09:45---->00:10:30]:
tend to see is a movement or interaction of some form that depends on change in dipole moment so if we look here our our electromagnetic radiation will have the light in three dimensions so it could be on the X plane the Y plane and Z plane so here we're just trying to claim the flame polarized light so for example along the X Y plane yeah this this creep here we are electromagnetic radiation is uh going along this wavelength here and if we look at for example our rotation so if we have HCL at our HCL molecule here we'll have a dipole all right so here I hate to see all the point in sort of the dipole is pointing

Video Extract : Introduction to Molecular Spectroscopy: Lecture 1 Rotational Spectroscopy
[00:10:30---->00:11:15]:
directly upwards and the molecule rotates so it rotates around so here's rotating around anti-clockwise from here the dipole is function directly to the left keep rotating around would be pointing directly down and then rotate it around a bit more I'll be rotating to the right and so on so this this dipole will be continuously changing around so if I draw a graph just looking at the dipole pointing directly upwards what will that graph look like but obviously at the point where it's quantity directly upwards that would be the height of the title interaction to the pointing either left or right well then there will be no Vector pointing up to zero I'm just pointing directly down part of the most negative

Video Extract : Introduction to Molecular Spectroscopy: Lecture 1 Rotational Spectroscopy
[00:11:15---->00:12:00]:
values so we've seen thoracious molecule rotates we are we are generating a wave and light will interact with molecules once the wavelengths of the two interactions are the same so what you may have come across before the transition dipole environment is an operator there that is mapping on the rotation of the molecule with the wavelength of light and that transition dipole moment is saying well how is the wavelength comparing to each other so once this wavelength here matches the wavelength of the electromagnetic radiation but then we talk about the molecule absorbing satellite this is how

Video Extract : Introduction to Molecular Spectroscopy: Lecture 1 Rotational Spectroscopy
[00:12:00---->00:12:45]:
large for vibrations again so the vibrations will lead to Temporary change and dipoles and again we can map that that dipole change so as a as a wave and again once that wave is of the same wavelength of the electromagnetic radiation in this case infrared radiation well then the molecule will absorb absorbed a lot okay so I opened this lecture with a typical classical rotation Spectrum what we want to look at here is what we are seeing okay so here we're seeing lots and lots of lines in our fraction and I'm just going to take their shape we're seeing the pattern all the lines are equally spaced and so on so what I want to do in this this lecture we're going

Video Extract : Introduction to Molecular Spectroscopy: Lecture 1 Rotational Spectroscopy
[00:12:45---->00:13:30]:
to talk about rotation and how rotation leads to these kinds of Spectra so if we look at rotations okay so remember we mentioned that in vibrations well vibrations you are familiar with infrared by just to be in knowing about the carbon oxygen Bond vibration and so on about 1700 wave numbers that's because vibrations lead to change in bond dipoles whereas rotation is the whole molecule okay the dipole is change and you've got the whole molecule rotate it so rotation on rotational spectroscopy differs from vibrational tetroscopy because it's a whole molecule Spectrum so in other words once we have more than one atom in there it's not going to tell us information about specific parts of it only but the whole molecule now there

Video Extract : Introduction to Molecular Spectroscopy: Lecture 1 Rotational Spectroscopy
[00:13:30---->00:14:15]:
are clever things we can do isotopic substitution and so on that you'll probably see next year but for our purposes for patient petroscopy is as you see very powerful but also quite limited because it's just telling us about the whole molecule so that's why we tend to use it with a very simple very simple molecules so we're going to use rotation to adjust the boot really as a way of explaining how we think about energy levels and energy transitions if possible so rotation potassium is a whole molecule catroscopy typically in the gas phase obviously we want to be able to see um molecules rotate they need to be able to be free to rotate so that tends to only happen in the gas phase but it's a very very sensitive technique so

Video Extract : Introduction to Molecular Spectroscopy: Lecture 1 Rotational Spectroscopy
[00:14:15---->00:15:00]:
therefore only tiny amounts of molecules need to be in the grass phase and for us to protect them so that's why for example it's a classic technique used in acid pastures that cross between that I was studying um molecules in the solar system for identification purposes this idea of regular spaced lines should make you jump up and screen as quantized energy okay so we should have this sense that this means that we are moving from Individual energy levels of discrete amounts so that current quantization you're probably used to infrared petrocity being from about 500 wave numbers to about 4 000 wave members okay you see it's much less it's probably about 10 to 100 weight number so this is

Video Extract : Introduction to Molecular Spectroscopy: Lecture 1 Rotational Spectroscopy
[00:15:00---->00:15:45]:
telling us again the much lower amounts of energy the much longer wavelengths that are involved in rotation and you can probably even imagine that imagine the molecule rotating around much slower kind of molecule vibration so you can imagine the equation is much shorter so in spectroscopy we use things called selection rules and this is essentially a way it's saying how do we know whether or not a transition is allowed or probability in the notes that a company that I've given a little bit more detail on this but really the core message here is we are able to say when we look at Transitions and look at their Symmetry and look at the quantum the wave function associated with that we're able

Video Extract : Introduction to Molecular Spectroscopy: Lecture 1 Rotational Spectroscopy
[00:15:45---->00:16:30]:
to say well is this allowed from a Quantum Quantum chemical point of view and this this bits of rules what are called selection rules and here as I mentioned a growth selection rule with an overall headline selection rule for rotation and petrocity is the um there must be a change in the dipole it's a no change in guidepost of so for example if I have nitrogen and two rotated well there'll be no change in dipole as that rotates to the whole we're not going to see how rotational Spectrum okay so we need to begin to start to quantify now what we mean by rotation so here we may have some diatomic molecules and if we reconfigure that diatomic molecule using What's called the reduced

Video Extract : Introduction to Molecular Spectroscopy: Lecture 1 Rotational Spectroscopy
[00:16:30---->00:17:15]:
Mass but then we can think about one one unit moving around a circle and this is just much easier mathematically to to um to use in our in a consideration the power we're talking about a radius here which is impractically the bond length um of the molecules but it only relies on one Mass term rather than not two so this reduced Mass idea where we combine the masses okay so here you see this new symbol is the reduced Mass this is the product movement of other masses divided by the sum of the masses okay if you can't remember which is which produce class is a mass so therefore it has kilograms units or grams units so therefore the units must spread out to be a mass unit here so the product

Video Extract : Introduction to Molecular Spectroscopy: Lecture 1 Rotational Spectroscopy
[00:17:15---->00:18:00]:
divided by the sum will leave us between us for example kilograms and the extent of this um rotation um we want to think about removing atoms through space what what does that mean energetically that can be Quantified using the moment of inertia that removing this atom through space but it's going to take a certain amount of energy to move it and the extent of God is the the moment of inertia the moment of the Nationalist tells us well how heavy of an object are we moving through how how long does the radio start removing the truth so obviously the longer that is the higher the moment of inertia all right so let's just tease that out with some with some

Video Extract : Introduction to Molecular Spectroscopy: Lecture 1 Rotational Spectroscopy
[00:18:00---->00:18:45]:
um examples and this first example we're asking um to calculate the moment of inertia if you know the sponge length of CO2 so if you might want to pause the video here and try it yourself but I'm just going to switch to the document camera so once you press play again we can go through the or through the answers okay so we have Co and what's Happening Here is our CEO is rotating but we are moving oxygen to space and

Video Extract : Introduction to Molecular Spectroscopy: Lecture 1 Rotational Spectroscopy
[00:18:45---->00:19:30]:
carbon through space so we want to get some sense at the moment of inertia oh it's a moment of inertia I is equal to reduce mass and applied by the bond radius squared for Mu is equal to M1 times M2 over M1 plus M2 so first of all we need to calculate the reduced Mass correct well so we know that the mass of 12 carbon is equal to well let's put it into kilograms will be 12. by 10 to the minus 3 kilograms per mole y because we're going

Video Extract : Introduction to Molecular Spectroscopy: Lecture 1 Rotational Spectroscopy
[00:19:30---->00:20:15]:
to come out with SI units at the end of our list so we need to do kilograms uh and to get rid of the parallel we'll divide by Avogadro 6.022 .23 caramel clock is in the 1.9 1.99 3 5 10 to the minus 26. sometimes so good check is you tend to get 10 to the minus 26 10 to the minus 27. um kilograms when you're talking about the karma classes you can do the same for oxygen oxygen will be equal to 16

Video Extract : Introduction to Molecular Spectroscopy: Lecture 1 Rotational Spectroscopy
[00:20:15---->00:21:00]:
.995 taking the actual forecast multiplied by 10 to the minor three kilograms from those divided by avocado and that gives me 2.657 plus 10 to the minus 26. kilograms and again a check here is 10 to the minus 26. so now we know our mass is in um kilograms so we can just stick those into reduce mass formula so it's 1.993

Video Extract : Introduction to Molecular Spectroscopy: Lecture 1 Rotational Spectroscopy
[00:21:00---->00:21:45]:
times 3.657 over the sum so we'll have kilograms squared upstairs kilograms downstairs block is me a reduced mass of 1.1390 500 minus 26 kilograms all right so you can see it's a bit

Video Extract : Introduction to Molecular Spectroscopy: Lecture 1 Rotational Spectroscopy
[00:21:45---->00:22:30]:
laborious but very very straightforward um so now to go back to our I is equal to U H squared that means 26. kilograms multiplied by all point one one three I think minus nine meters whole squared graph equal to 1.454

Video Extract : Introduction to Molecular Spectroscopy: Lecture 1 Rotational Spectroscopy
[00:22:30---->00:23:15]:
potential minus 46. cardigan meters squared okay and again we typically see values of 10 to the minus four to six hundred minus 47 nsiu that's right what does that mean that's telling us um how much it is taking to move a mass through a particular area it's giving us a sense of the effort involved effectively in rotating and rotating this molecule so now that obviously depends on the bond length

Video Extract : Introduction to Molecular Spectroscopy: Lecture 1 Rotational Spectroscopy
[00:23:15---->00:24:00]:
okay so the band length is um Square just keep those numbers in your head as kind of sensible values for these um so obviously we can do the reverse and I'm not quite sure here that E2 round two levels um but I think when you work it out you get a moment of inertia of 2.639 so obviously as we are lengthening the

Video Extract : Introduction to Molecular Spectroscopy: Lecture 1 Rotational Spectroscopy
[00:24:00---->00:24:45]:
value of or well because I is equal to u r squared the longer we make or the larger the moment inertia becomes all right so let's move on a little bit now so what we'll take what we're thinking about and put it into Quantum terms and um the um the the way to think about this is we need to think about how the rotation what's happening in the molecule when we rotate it and if I have a molecule so here I'm holding a pen and I rotate it I can rotate it in the plane of the board so I'm rotating it so

Video Extract : Introduction to Molecular Spectroscopy: Lecture 1 Rotational Spectroscopy
[00:24:45---->00:25:30]:
that it's staying in the chain of the board where I can rotate it so that it's perpendicular to the board rotation towards the camera or I can rotate it so that it is part in the plane of the floor because there's obviously three dimensions three axes on which we can rotate it the reason to choose diatomic molecule is going to simplifies the simplifier so that if I have diatomic that means rotation around the axis that are around the length of the bond isn't actually moving molecules through space so we'll have what's called zero angular momentum around the line well let's sort of say that again if we have for example

Video Extract : Introduction to Molecular Spectroscopy: Lecture 1 Rotational Spectroscopy
[00:25:30---->00:26:15]:
you just take a tube if you rotate that tube so that it rotates end to end but obviously we're moving Mass through space the Libya moment inertia but if you rotate that through just around the axis of a tube but then we're not moving Masters base so therefore there is no problem entrepreneurship for the energy over determined by the angular momentum along the other two axis okay around the axis where we are moving the Master's base so for example around the plane the floor and around the corner cord and because this has a very similar arrangement to the children equation and you've used that to derive for example SP and B orbitals you end up with a very

Video Extract : Introduction to Molecular Spectroscopy: Lecture 1 Rotational Spectroscopy
[00:26:15---->00:27:00]:
similar type of discretion for rotation of energy levels severity energy of rotation in joules is given by this expression that we have some some quantities and you see a moment of inertia appears in here upon the rotational energy levels times rotation energy level plus one this is essentially if you um think about transitions that we're interested in is from one rotational energy level to another so we end up with this expression and we normally use as I mentioned wave numbers that means I can divide it across by HC so now we get the energy of our rotational state is equal to the

Video Extract : Introduction to Molecular Spectroscopy: Lecture 1 Rotational Spectroscopy
[00:27:00---->00:27:45]:
energy in Joule divided by HC that means I got rid of the one of the H's and H squared and I end up with C downstairs here and this this value here H over 8 pi squared CI is usually just summarized as B the rotational constant okay sometimes written BV depending on the rotational constant vibration level we're in um so here we'll just write a c this is the equation for underpinning quotations atrocity okay the energy of a rotational state will be equal to the rotational constant itself deriving from the moment inertia times the rotational state times rotational state of the next value up and this is all a bit abstract what I'd like to do to show you what does this means in terms of

Video Extract : Introduction to Molecular Spectroscopy: Lecture 1 Rotational Spectroscopy
[00:27:45---->00:28:30]:
my paperback what's this mean in terms of actual um the molecule rotating it comes to 3D is a great source so here we've got instruction bonding sister from London the custody location knowledge grapples somewhere there all right so here we have various values

Video Extract : Introduction to Molecular Spectroscopy: Lecture 1 Rotational Spectroscopy
[00:28:30---->00:29:15]:
of J our XJ is equal to zero J is equal to one and so on and you can see here um we've got our energy QJ upon James so what this means is if I have a j my molecule is in the J is equal to one energy level it's rotating a bit if I have it in the Jersey to the two energy levels pertaining a little bit more and so on and the three more so all these all these different J values mean is the molecules we're taking the faster and and what we talk about then we talk about rotational transition is that we

Video Extract : Introduction to Molecular Spectroscopy: Lecture 1 Rotational Spectroscopy
[00:29:15---->00:30:00]:
use the molecule was here and we gave it enough energy so that it could go from one to two just rotates a little bit more all right and sometimes it's important to remember that because it can get lost in lots of equations but really when we talk about it spectroscopic transition it just means the molecule goes from one particular state quotational terms that just means this rotating is more the key thing is is that these are discrete these are defined it's not going to get a little bit faster than the faster is the faster you know and so on it's going to go from one rotational speed to another it is quantized but that means we see discrete transitions

Video Extract : Introduction to Molecular Spectroscopy: Lecture 1 Rotational Spectroscopy
[00:30:00---->00:30:45]:
okay so what I want to just tease out now is talking about Energies and transitions so again there's a YouTube video going over this but I'll just go over some parts of it so in this in this first part you want the partner the energies of the uh Jessica zero JCP one and J is equal to two levels all right so if we think about this for how we're going to do this well if we look at the equation we know we know that the

Video Extract : Introduction to Molecular Spectroscopy: Lecture 1 Rotational Spectroscopy
[00:30:45---->00:31:30]:
um on the back here we're given the moment of inertia thank you so give me a moment of inertia so that means we can use the moment of inertia to calculate the rotational constants we can acknowledge this V here I'm going to use the rotational constant to calculate the energy all right so we want to say that um we know that b is equal to H over eight pi squared c times I so we need that's equal to 6.636 by 10 to the minus

Video Extract : Introduction to Molecular Spectroscopy: Lecture 1 Rotational Spectroscopy
[00:31:30---->00:32:15]:
44 and two seconds times eight times two one sorry eight times uh 2.14 squared times 3 by 10 to the power of 10 centimeters per second okay we use speed of light in centimeters per second times the moment of the nursery to our television four five four five hundred minus 47 chronograph meters squared because I um one jewel is is equal to planogram meters squared per second squared

Video Extract : Introduction to Molecular Spectroscopy: Lecture 1 Rotational Spectroscopy
[00:32:15---->00:33:00]:
well the view here will cancel the paragraph meter third per second meter squared here and the per second squared will come through the second here upstairs and the parasite Advanced here so we'll be left a few minutes one over a centimeter or a weight number so that's why we like to use speed of light and centimeters per second because it puts a bit sent away from the value that gives me 1.92 grade numbers so now because the um I'll go back here to all right so we've looked in a value and we get a 1.92 code number now what we're interesting is calculating the energy of our rotational

Video Extract : Introduction to Molecular Spectroscopy: Lecture 1 Rotational Spectroscopy
[00:33:00---->00:33:45]:
States where we know the the p-value that's pretty straightforward now the energy of the rotational State EJ is equal to B J upon J plus one therefore the energy of the zero rotation state would be equal to 1.92 upon zero times zero this one is equal to zero in other words a molecule in the zero rotation State isn't rotating now that's the case for occasional petroscopy that you'll see not for vibrational tetracy so that that ground energy level zero so here we have change it to zero

Video Extract : Introduction to Molecular Spectroscopy: Lecture 1 Rotational Spectroscopy
[00:33:45---->00:34:30]:
the energy is zero how about one oh we've got E1 is equal to 1.92 times one times two now if you can see 3.8 foreign

Video Extract : Introduction to Molecular Spectroscopy: Lecture 1 Rotational Spectroscopy
[00:34:30---->00:35:15]:
and so on so we see is the gap between each rotational state is starting to increase and when we work it out we'll see it's actually increasing by an amount to be each time why because you're adding around plus one all the time here so we're increasing this time amount to be each time Happening by transition is getting longer each time finding a 19 2B so if you remember our Spectrum what we see here is we see the zero to one condition appearing here for one two conditions that should be three point

Video Extract : Introduction to Molecular Spectroscopy: Lecture 1 Rotational Spectroscopy
[00:35:15---->00:36:00]:
four zero two transition sorry the one to two transition but what would that be E2 minus E1 11.85 minus 3.84 so that's even 7.69 card number so we'll see a peak for this transition of 4B this is where we're getting the series of regular space lines so the graph is always to be between them so the next one is going to be 60 and so on okay so once we calculate these Energies

Video Extract : Introduction to Molecular Spectroscopy: Lecture 1 Rotational Spectroscopy
[00:36:00---->00:36:45]:
we're supposed to calculate the energies we're able to see that the increase in energy increases by the same amount each time so we go from J to zero no energy two is equal to one an energy 2B which is equal to two manage of 60 and so on that means the difference between of these and the difference is the transition which is what we are interested in as they cost you okay the difference is the transition which is what we're interested in for possible so this difference increases Finance QB each time so when we look at our Spectrum called the scene is a series of regularly spaced lines each to be more energy than the previous one you see that very clearly here that our series of conditions

Video Extract : Introduction to Molecular Spectroscopy: Lecture 1 Rotational Spectroscopy
[00:36:45---->00:37:30]:
we want to work out a condition is very easy you just have to take the value from to an energy level away from the Nets so when we're asked to operate number that's the Jersey to the 13th edition up here we'll just have to subtract the lower value from your form here uh and then the last one the trick question really but just to highlight that it's another selection rule in rotational spectroscopy is that the value of J can only change by one in um rotational petroscopy so J is plus or minus one and that's to do with potentially the fact of the molecule needs to rotate one full time before we're back to the start again before

Video Extract : Introduction to Molecular Spectroscopy: Lecture 1 Rotational Spectroscopy
[00:37:30---->00:38:15]:
we're back thinking about the next wavelength okay so the selection rule here Delta J plus or minus one seems we only will see in our Spectrum transitions that are due to an increase of J or decrease of J by one all right so what this means then is as I mentioned that we're seeing the series of regularly space lines each due to a condition that is getting longer for an amount 2D each time okay so here we see a value of 2B value of 4B value of 60 and so on so the differences between the energy levels are increasing by an amount to be each time and as we can see those differences

Video Extract : Introduction to Molecular Spectroscopy: Lecture 1 Rotational Spectroscopy
[00:38:15---->00:39:00]:
really depend on the moment of inertia you'll see very very large values of B 60 for hydrogen very very like molecule that's really it's been very rapidly and as we increase the mass of the diatomic in other words so change in the moment of inertia you see that the decrease so as we saw is about 1.92 1.93 for carbon monoxide so I'm going to punch you now to a very common query that comes up through all of my years in teaching rotations atrocity and that is the difference between the energy levels and the energies of transitions okay so we have used quantum chemistry to come up with what these energy levels

are they have this determined that the energy level of a rotational state is BJ upon J plus one that these energy levels correspond to the molecule rotating a certain amount so I'm not rotating at all energy level zero to rotating a little bit energy level one rotating a little bit lower energy level two and so on they are the energy levels but we are interested in a spectroscopy are the differences between these levels okay and you can see that these differences are getting larger and

Video Extract : Introduction to Molecular Spectroscopy: Lecture 1 Rotational Spectroscopy
[00:39:45---->00:40:30]:
larger each time so don't go back and all right slide here we can see that the energy levels are Quantified by DJ upon J plus one but the differences between these Energies again this is on the last line just by taking one energy level away from the one next to it so in other words we take energy level J plus one and subtract from that the energy level J which we call the spectroscopic transition okay this new with the bar

Video Extract : Introduction to Molecular Spectroscopy: Lecture 1 Rotational Spectroscopy
[00:40:30---->00:41:15]:
over it means it's the energy and wave numbers which is as per capacity transition which is equal to we just we just say it would be square plus one here so the first value of J for the second so it will do J upon u j plus one upon J plus two minus B J upon J plus one okay so this is the J plus one energy level this is the J energy level and we get this expression for a spectroscopic transition to the 2B upon J plus one in other words the transition will increase fine amount to the difference between the conditions will be different by the amount to be each time all right now this is a very very common

[00:41:15---->00:42:00]:
query because students are confusing the energy of the molecule supplied by this expression and the energy of the transition described by this discretion so just make sure you're clear on that on your head the rotations that we see are the energies themselves the spectroscopic transitions are the amounts of energy you need to get from a slower rotation to a faster rotation all right so where does all this leave us so so far now we have worked out the um energy levels of rotational States we've worked out the differences in those energy levels and that's the

Video Extract : Introduction to Molecular Spectroscopy: Lecture 1 Rotational Spectroscopy
[00:42:00---->00:42:45]:
difference the lights on this relates to this property we're calling the rotational constant the rotational constant B connects us with the moment of inertia which gives us information um Bond lengths and on the masses of the atoms in the bombs in other words the difference we are seeing in our Spectrum tiny difference here so between these two peaks between these two peaks is 2b so we can take that 2B value and we can relate it to the moment of inertia and we can then use that to calculate for example Bond lengths or Bond um molecule muscles so what we're seeing here is our

Video Extract : Introduction to Molecular Spectroscopy: Lecture 1 Rotational Spectroscopy
[00:42:45---->00:43:30]:
transition zero to one one two two three two four and so on so these are all increasing by number two B that's what I mean any difference here between these two um between two peaks will give us a tiny TV so when you're interpreting a molecular rotational Spectrum or a microwave Spectrum what you take from an r2p values next to each other because throughout the J is plus or minus one and then that that difference would be the true blue value which opens up lots of information about whatever description all right characteristic of rotational structure is that the line intensity increases all right so we see here is quite low and then it's getting higher and higher

Video Extract : Introduction to Molecular Spectroscopy: Lecture 1 Rotational Spectroscopy
[00:43:30---->00:44:15]:
and higher and then starts to decrease again so it rises up to a maximum and then falls off again and this transition intensity must relate to the population of energy levels okay in other words we will not see a transition from an energy level if no molecules are in the state there's no molecules within that energy level so we can't go from a molecule rotating for example and the J is equal to foot three for the J is equal to four if no molecules are in the J is equal to three state for the population of energy levels is directly proportional to the condition probability that comes from them so spectral line intensity will depend

Video Extract : Introduction to Molecular Spectroscopy: Lecture 1 Rotational Spectroscopy
[00:44:15---->00:45:00]:
on the population of the energy level no matter with how many molecules are actually in that state how many molecules are rotating at that particular speed or rotating at a speed passer or whatever they'll all be different energy states so obviously the greater the number of molecules in a particular level the higher the probability of a transition so therefore the more intensive signal so we could say that molecules that transitions will be more likely to come from this state or more intense in this state than it will be from this one because more molecules are in this state and we can get a sense of the relative populations of States using both men expressions under both my Expressions essentially

Video Extract : Introduction to Molecular Spectroscopy: Lecture 1 Rotational Spectroscopy
[00:45:00---->00:45:45]:
says that the the relative population in other words how many molecules are in the upper state divided by how many molecules are in the Lower State will depend on several factors the first thing is it'll depend on the degeneracy of that state so if we have an energy level let's say we have for example an S orbital of an S orbital as a particular energy level and there's only one energy level at that energy but if we think of a p orbital well a p orbital will have a particular energy but there'll be three at that energy levels there are three degenerative P orbitals so we can say the same more generally the degeneracy of a particular state in other words the number of energy levels

Video Extract : Introduction to Molecular Spectroscopy: Lecture 1 Rotational Spectroscopy
[00:45:45---->00:46:30]:
at that State obviously mean there's more opportunity for molecules to be in that state so the relative population will depend on the generation the number of number of levels of the same energy it will also depend on the energy difference in the temperature for a molecule to move from one energy level to another while the population of the higher energy level will depend on how hard it is to get there so the larger that energy gap the less likely a molecule will be in the upper state if you think of our molecule rotating if we wanted to rotate so fast really fast at a very very high energy we're going to have to give it a lot of energy to to occupy that state so therefore it's less likely the higher

Video Extract : Introduction to Molecular Spectroscopy: Lecture 1 Rotational Spectroscopy
[00:46:30---->00:47:15]:
that energy level is for the Delta e value is quantifying how difficult is it energetically without energy level upstairs to be populated in the first place and kdt is giving us a sense of the temperature contribution in other words the extent to which molecules uh these higher energy states will be populated thermally in other words if we have um thermal energy that a molecule will exist in well then it's going to have to just distribute that energy across a range of energy levels but more likely that the higher energy level will be populated if they're thermally accessible respondsman distribution effectively quantifies the relationship or the ratio between the population of the Upper State and the population of the Lower

Video Extract : Introduction to Molecular Spectroscopy: Lecture 1 Rotational Spectroscopy
[00:47:15---->00:48:00]:
State and that then gives us a way of working out or thinking about Peak intensity so if we have for example electronic transitions well here temperature isn't really a consideration the Gap is so large that these higher states are not going to be permanently occupied we have to give so much temperature so much heat to raise the temperature of the system that the molecule will probably decompose before we were able to provide that enough energy to reach the higher state the thermal occupation is important when we think about vibrational and especially rotational States because the energy gap between them is very very small so it's very easy for the Heat and the system to distribute across these

Video Extract : Introduction to Molecular Spectroscopy: Lecture 1 Rotational Spectroscopy
[00:48:00---->00:48:45]:
energy levels the second law of Thermodynamics drives that forward energy will distribute as much as possible so vibrant populations of vibration rotational energy will depend on temperature so what we are seeing is an increase in our in our spectrum and that's because of the first half of the postman expression rotational states are degenerated by 2G plus one in other words so two J plus one in other words uh if J is equal to one the first um energy level we're going to strictly degenerate just like a p orbital is trip

Video Extract : Introduction to Molecular Spectroscopy: Lecture 1 Rotational Spectroscopy
[00:48:45---->00:49:30]:
to the general if J is equal to two hold down two J plus one is five so there are five energy levels the general energy levels for the J is equal to two level so that mean just like a b orbiting for example has a five uh um generous levels so that means then if there are more levels there's more chance for those levels to be populated at that same energy so obviously as we go from Jersey to the one the Jersey to the jerseys of the truth the degeneracy of each of those levels of increasing according to two to eight plus one therefore the population of those levels are higher because it's molecule Rhythm has lots of levels the intensity will be more um as we increase but obviously this reaches a maximum

Video Extract : Introduction to Molecular Spectroscopy: Lecture 1 Rotational Spectroscopy
[00:49:30---->00:50:15]:
okay so we see a maximum here that if it was only the generous people then this peak would just keep increasing um the intensity would increase as J increased but it starts to level off and it starts to level up because it's the second reason in the second part of the development aggression which is this comparison between the energy gap and the possibility of parallel occupation so obviously as this energy drop increases the thermal population that it was just due to the temperature of the molecule decreases because the molecule doesn't have enough energy as heat to populate those higher those higher energy levels so as the rotational levels start to get

Video Extract : Introduction to Molecular Spectroscopy: Lecture 1 Rotational Spectroscopy
[00:50:15---->00:51:00]:
larger the Gap gets larger and larger away from the lowest level but then the possibility of occupying those thermally starts to really decrease so we see even though there are a lot of the general levels there are very few molecules in those States so therefore the intensity of the peak are the probability of transition from those reduces so this is just kind of an overview of of why a rotational spectrum that we see yes we understand the equal space lines but now we can also understand why is it an increase in intensity and then a decrease in intensity giving these beautiful symmetric structure okay so I won't go through this exercise in detail but the great value of this now is we can get a sense of relative

Video Extract : Introduction to Molecular Spectroscopy: Lecture 1 Rotational Spectroscopy
[00:51:00---->00:51:45]:
populations at whatever temperature we like all right so here we can see the energy gap and this is one of the few occasions where we use energy in joules and petroscopy okay because we need Sr units if we're going to use the most non-constant so here my energy gap is in joules so we can uh plug in our value for change into the one which is equal to zero well because it's the degeneracy of J is equal to one it's two J plus one so it'll be three divided by one so and one over and zero will be three over one times this exponential where we plug in our Delta e value and we can see that the postman contribution here is tiny because we're coming out in value pretty much relating

Video Extract : Introduction to Molecular Spectroscopy: Lecture 1 Rotational Spectroscopy
[00:51:45---->00:52:30]:
to the generation so the N1 over n0 value population um is about three that's the one but that's why the peak that we see in uh coming out quite as well as we've helped here but this peak here in principle should be three times the intensity of this peak here all right um and we can we can go on but the advantage I'm not going to go into this point because you pick it up next year is that we can turn this around and we can say well we know what the relative populations of two states would be at a particular temperature so if we look at the relative intensities of Peaks we can find that the temperature of the source and this is a really good way of studying temperatures so we can actually

Video Extract : Introduction to Molecular Spectroscopy: Lecture 1 Rotational Spectroscopy
[00:52:30---->00:53:15]:
use rotational spectross to find our temperatures and this is a common example of for example Interstellar spectroscopy where you can actually estimate the temperatures of the molecules at the source that we're looking at so very useful expression so if you sense of how that might happen the um obviously the larger the value of uh Delta e which in itself is related to B um the more impact it's going to have on the spectrum because remember B will tell us about the gap between two energy states so the larger B is the bigger that Gap is the bigger that Gap is the quicker we move we get that it's both

Video Extract : Introduction to Molecular Spectroscopy: Lecture 1 Rotational Spectroscopy
[00:53:15---->00:54:00]:
non-restriction of thermal occupational States so you can see when B is much larger the spectral attempts to start to decrease much more quickly than when B is smaller okay so as we make that Gap harder and harder to jump thermally but then the thermal cut off fits in earlier so that's why some that's why the energy gap here will give us a sense of um the Spectrum and we can use that we can use that almost visually when we look especially to get a get a sense of the relative extent or size of the rotational quantity okay so um this also allows us to determine what

Video Extract : Introduction to Molecular Spectroscopy: Lecture 1 Rotational Spectroscopy
[00:54:00---->00:54:45]:
the maximum occupied state will be what level should we see the most intense Peak coming from all right and that that will that will be essentially what the highest peak is in our Spectrum but if we model the Spectrum just like I have in this curve in in this curve but by using this expression well then the point at which the slope is zero and this Curve will equate to the inflection point here in our in our spectrum that always the point at which it levels off and start to decrease again so if we can essentially get the derivative of this expression set that derivative is equal to zero so then we can work out the J value which

Video Extract : Introduction to Molecular Spectroscopy: Lecture 1 Rotational Spectroscopy
[00:54:45---->00:55:30]:
has the maximum population the highest occupied population or where we will see the most intense Peak for clinical physics are anybody mathematically inclined if you want to have a poet arriving that's a little bit of quite easy a little bit of fun but essentially what we can see here is that this J max value would obviously depend on the temperature of the system in other words how easily that a higher energy state is reached and the rotational constant in other words the extent of the gap between energy states okay so that's a pretty good place to stop this core so if I just go back to our Spectrum but I'm trying to get across is first of all we can use rotation of spectroscopy

Video Extract : Introduction to Molecular Spectroscopy: Lecture 1 Rotational Spectroscopy
[00:55:30---->00:56:15]:
as a really good model for explaining energy levels and transitions between energy levels okay so we're teasing out here things like um thinking about respectful Transitions and working out energy differences things like um talking about degeneracy and population intensity so obviously the more populated an energy state is the more likely you will see a transition from that energy state and also starting to tease out particular issues associated with shape and Spectra and then we can use Spectra spectroscopically to think about well here I can derive the rotational constant B because the gap between these two peaks would be 2B that gives me a moment of inertia which gives me Bond length and so on or because the shade in the spectrum is related to the temperature I can use

Video Extract : Introduction to Molecular Spectroscopy: Lecture 1 Rotational Spectroscopy
[00:56:15---->00:57:00]:
that to get some information about the temperature of the sample just to give you kind of a preview as to where this goes next so I mentioned that rotation spectroscopy is a whole molecule petroscopy that can be a bit of a nuisance when you want to know some information about some individual component normally we turn to vibration to costume but there are clever ways of using other topic substitution because with isotopic substitution the bond length doesn't change but obviously the reduced mass will so if we think about our moment of inertia equation the moment of inertia will change due to band from sorry due to reduce Mass but not with the bond length and that allows this workout different rotational constants due to isotopic substitution which means we can probe the molecule in different ways

Video Extract : Introduction to Molecular Spectroscopy: Lecture 1 Rotational Spectroscopy
[00:57:00---->00:57:45]:
that's that's picked up I think next year one major assumption we've had in our course this year is that we've assumed that our molecule is rigid as it rotates that bond is basically a piece of plastic joined together the two atoms at the end so as it rotates faster and faster and faster nothing happens to that but of course in reality that bond is essentially overlapping Atomic orbitals holding together to molecules and as it rotates faster and faster and faster the bond will actually start to vibrate so as the molecules rotate in classroom fastening from vibrates and obviously as it vibrates the average length the bond is going to start increasing the length is about increases then that affects our rotational constant B so we

Video Extract : Introduction to Molecular Spectroscopy: Lecture 1 Rotational Spectroscopy
[00:57:45---->00:58:30]:
need to account for what's called Distortion due to rotation that actually also gives us lots of really useful information about the molecule in other words because that relates to vibration we're able to get some vibrational information and then of course you know life is not just diatomic molecules so there's a question of how do we take this forward a polyatomic molecules in theory it's very difficult there's a lot of maths behind it but actually in practice it works out very straightforward for a whole cohort of types of molecules so you'll see some useful tricks in chemistry 2 next year all right so the tutorial questions really will pick up on lots of aspects of using rotational Spectra and how we can find information from location
